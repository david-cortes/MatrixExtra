Description: Extends sparse matrix and vector classes from the 'Matrix' package by providing: 
  (a) Methods and operators that work natively on CSR formats (compressed sparse row, 
  a.k.a. 'RsparseMatrix') such as slicing/sub-setting, assignment, rbind(), 
  mathematical operators for CSR and COO such as addition ("+") or sqrt(), and methods such as diag(); 
  (b) Multi-threaded matrix multiplication and cross-product for many <sparse, dense> types, 
  including the 'float32' type from 'float'; 
  (c) Coercion methods between pairs of classes which are not present in 'Matrix', 
  such as 'dgCMatrix' -> 'ngRMatrix', as well as convenience conversion functions; 
  (d) Utility functions for sparse matrices such as sorting the indices or removing 
  zero-valued entries; 
  (e) Fast transposes that work by outputting in the opposite storage format;
  (f) Faster replacements for many 'Matrix' methods for all sparse types, such as
  slicing and elementwise multiplication.
  (g) Convenience functions for sparse objects, such as 'mapSparse' or a shorter 'show' method.
